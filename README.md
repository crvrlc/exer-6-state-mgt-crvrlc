## Application Description
This program added the checkout feature from the sample state management app from the laboratory handout.

## Things you did in the code
A button for checkout is created on the My Cart page. When clicked, it will be redirected to the Checkout Page. If the cart is empty, the checkout page is empty and displays "No items to checkout". If not, item details are shown such as its name and price, as well as the total amount. Once Pay Now is clicked, the total will be set to zero and will output a “Payment Successful” prompt at the snack bar, and will go back to the My Catalog page.

## Challenges when developing the application
Some of the challenges I faced developing the code are:
- understanding the use of context.read and context.watch
- creating a new page for checkout
- displaying the item details on the checkout page
- enhancing UI and UX
